///
/// Flags are used to signal various expected behaviours to the Script Interpreter.
///
///
/// __Flags are taken from the bitcoind implementation__
///
/// ## SCRIPT_VERIFY_P2SH
/// Evaluate P2SH subscripts (softfork safe, BIP16).
///
/// ## SCRIPT_VERIFY_STRICTENC
/// Passing a non-strict-DER signature or one with undefined hashtype to a checksig operation causes script failure.
/// Passing a pubkey that is not (0x04 + 64 bytes) or (0x02 or 0x03 + 32 bytes) to checksig causes that pubkey to be
/// skipped (not softfork safe: this flag can widen the validity of OP_CHECKSIG OP_NOT).
///
/// ## SCRIPT_VERIFY_DERSIG
/// Passing a non-strict-DER signature to a checksig operation causes script failure (softfork safe, BIP62 rule 1)
///
/// ## SCRIPT_VERIFY_LOW_S
/// Pa non-strict-DER signature or one with S > order/2 to a checksig operation causes script failure
/// (softfork safe, BIP62 rule 5).
///
/// ## SCRIPT_VERIFY_NULLDUMMY
/// verify dummy stack item consumed by CHECKMULTISIG is of zero-length (softfork safe, BIP62 rule 7).
///
/// ## SCRIPT_VERIFY_SIGPUSHONLY
/// Using a non-push operator in the scriptSig causes script failure (softfork safe, BIP62 rule 2).
///
/// ## SCRIPT_VERIFY_MINIMALDATA
/// Require minimal encodings for all push operations (OP_0... OP_16, OP_1NEGATE where possible, direct
/// pushes up to 75 bytes, OP_PUSHDATA up to 255 bytes, OP_PUSHDATA2 for anything larger). Evaluating
/// any other push causes the script to fail (BIP62 rule 3).
/// In addition, whenever a stack element is interpreted as a number, it must be of minimal length (BIP62 rule 4).
/// (softfork safe)
///
/// ## SCRIPT_VERIFY_DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS
/// Discourage use of NOPs reserved for upgrades (NOP1-10).
/// Provided so that nodes can avoid accepting or mining transactions
/// containing executed NOP's whose meaning may change after a soft-fork,
/// thus rendering the script invalid; with this flag set executing
/// discouraged NOPs fails the script. This verification flag will never be
/// a mandatory flag applied to scripts in a block. NOPs that are not
/// executed, e.g.  within an unexecuted IF ENDIF block, are *not* rejected.
///
/// ## SCRIPT_VERIFY_CLEANSTACK
/// Require that only a single stack element remains after evaluation. This
/// changes the success criterion from "At least one stack element must
/// remain, and when interpreted as a boolean, it must be true" to "Exactly
/// one stack element must remain, and when interpreted as a boolean, it must
/// be true".
/// (softfork safe, BIP62 rule 6)
/// Note: CLEANSTACK should never be used without P2SH or WITNESS.
///
/// ## SCRIPT_VERIFY_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY
/// Cstatic final LTV See BIP65 for details.
///
/// ## SCRIPT_VERIFY_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY
/// support CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY opcode
/// See BIP112 for details
///
/// ## SCRIPT_VERIFY_MINIMALIF
/// Segwit script only: Require the argument of OP_IF/NOTIF to be exactly
/// 0x01 or empty vector
///
/// ## SCRIPT_VERIFY_NULLFAIL
/// Signature(s) must be empty vector if an CHECK(MULTI)SIG operation failed
///
/// ## SCRIPT_VERIFY_COMPRESSED_PUBKEYTYPE
/// Public keys in scripts must be compressed
///
/// ## SCRIPT_ENABLE_SIGHASH_FORKID
/// Do we accept signature using SIGHASH_FORKID
///
/// ## SCRIPT_ENABLE_REPLAY_PROTECTION
/// Do we accept activate replay protection using a different fork id.
///
/// ## SCRIPT_ENABLE_MONOLITH_OPCODES
/// Enable new opcodes.
///
/// ## SCRIPT_ENABLE_MAGNETIC_OPCODES
/// Are the Magnetic upgrade opcodes enabled?
///
///
/// __Below flags apply in the context of BIP 68__
///
/// ## SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME_DISABLE_FLAG
///  If this flag set, CTxIn::nSequence is NOT interpreted as a relative lock-time.
///
/// ## SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME_TYPE_FLAG
/// If CTxIn::nSequence encodes a relative lock-time and this flag is set,
/// the relative lock-time has units of 512 seconds, otherwise it specifies
/// blocks with a granularity of 1.
///
/// ## SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME_MASK
/// If CTxIn::nSequence encodes a relative lock-time, this mask is applied to
/// extract that lock-time from the sequence field.
